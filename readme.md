## WDI6 General Assembly Atlanta - PROJECT #1

For our first project we were to build an short sample app from one of the following:

- Tic-Tac-Toe or a variant of it (Super-Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4)
- Hangman
- Jeopardy

The objectives of this project:

- Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript/jQuery
- Solidify front-end skills by prototyping and building a site using HTML and CSS
- Practice app deployment, full SDLC

<br>

##PROJECT CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

* Use HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/jQuery with DOM manipulation
* Must be deployed

<br>




## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Implement multiple games on your site (you can add a RPS if you wish)
* Keep score
* Make it responsive
* Add A.I. (player vs. computer)
* Add avatar choices for the player 
* Add a timer
* Add music while a player makes a choice

<br>

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* Wireframes -- what does the app look like?
* Mock-ups (optional - for example, checkout Mockingbird)
* Stories in Trello -- what do your objectives look like, broken down into unit-sized chunks?
* GitHub -- create a repo for your app and show that you've been commiting early and often, while utilizing clear commit messages.


####Completed Project deliverables (Due ***Wednesday 4/6/2016***):

* Present your project Wednesday afternoon (around 3pm)
* [Link to Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/3waksLMO/tic-tac-toe)
* [Link to Deployed App](http://gokemon.github.io/tictactoe/)
* Link to Wirefames (photos will work too!)
* Link to mock-ups (if applicable)
* Link to source code on GitHub

## Code Example

I might want to show off the game loop


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* **Well-formatted.** Is this indented well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Sufficiently commented.** Will I understand what is going on in each block or function? If it's not clear, are there comments that indicate what you're doing?
* **Clear.** Do my naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at my app and understand what everything is?
* **Time Management.** Focus on core requirements (minimum viable product) before spending a lot of time on "bells and whistles."

We'll also be looking at:

* **Quality of communication around decision-making.** Can I tell you why I implemented my solution in a certain way? Can I tell you about alternative implementations I might have tried?
* **Ability to pick up new technologies and push self-knowledge.** How did I approach any new libraries/technologies and extend my learning into a working game?
